"""SN60 single-duel evaluation -- the legacy ``kata submission evaluate`` path.

Moved out of the generic submission workflow so the platform stays subnet-blind. Trusted
round winners are promoted without this duel (they skip it); it remains for the manual
``submission evaluate`` CLI and its tests. Relocates to ``kata-sn60`` in Phase 3.
