"""The subnet plugin contract (Phase 1 of the multi-subnet refactor).

A subnet plugin bundles everything subnet-specific -- task, environment, scorer, and
config -- behind one interface so the Kata core can run its King-of-the-Hill
competition without knowing what any subnet does. SN60 is just the first plugin.

Nothing calls this yet: SN60 is wrapped against it in Phase 2, and the core round /
decision paths are routed through it in Phases 3-4.
