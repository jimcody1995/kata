"""Layer 2 anti-gaming: the renaming-invariance canary.

A benchmark *memorizer* keys its findings on identifiers that are unique to specific
benchmark projects (e.g. ``redelegateWithdrawnHYPE``) and returns canned answers. Its
findings therefore *collapse* when those identifiers are renamed. A genuine analyzer
reasons about logic, not names, so its findings *survive* renaming.

This module renames the distinctive identifiers in a project's source and compares an
agent's findings on the original vs. the renamed source. Findings that appear verbatim
on the original but vanish under renaming are rename-dependent -- the signature of a
fingerprint. The result is a REVIEW signal (never an auto-reject): a human confirms.

The core (rename + compare) is pure and fully testable. Production wires
``run_rename_invariance_canary`` with a real sandbox agent runner and a source provider
that reads the project's source; those I/O seams are injected so this stays unit-tested.
