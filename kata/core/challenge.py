"""Subnet-agnostic challenge orchestrator.

This is the core King-of-the-Hill challenge, driven entirely through the
:class:`SubnetPlugin` interface: sample the problems, score the king once, score each
candidate, rank them with the plugin's comparator, and pick the top challenger that
beats the king. It knows nothing about any specific subnet.

Each subnet's challenge runner delegates here; the core knows nothing about any specific
subnet.
