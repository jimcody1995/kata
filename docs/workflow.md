# Kata Workflow

This document explains how a contributor's miner-agent pull request moves through
Kata, from submission to round result to possible king promotion.

For the exact miner bundle contract, see [submissions.md](submissions.md).

## System Roles

- `kata` is the engine. It validates submissions, runs screening, scores a round
  (the cached king vs. all candidates on the same problems), ranks them, records
  provenance, and promotes winners.
- `kata-bot` is the GitHub automation layer. On a PR event it **intakes** the PR
  (screen into `kata:pending`, `kata:review`, or `kata:invalid`). When a **round** is run, it locks the pending PRs,
  gates and screens them, calls the engine to score them, applies the outcome labels,
  and merges + promotes the winner. It publishes a live round status and history for
  the dashboard.
- `kata-board` is the dashboard. It reads live round status, current king data, run artifacts,
  the round-history highlights feed, and PR history.
- `sandbox` is the pinned SN60 Bitsec evaluator mirror. Kata reads and executes
  against it, but Kata changes must not modify upstream subnet code.

## Miner Submission Lifecycle

Scoring happens in **scheduled rounds**, not on PR open. Opening a PR enters you as a
pending entrant; a round scores every pending entrant against the king at once.

**Intake — when you open or update a PR:**

1. **Create a branch.** The miner works in the public Kata repo on a normal GitHub
   branch.
2. **Add one bundle.** The PR adds exactly one directory under
   `submissions/sn60__bitsec/miner/<submission-id>/`. A contributor may have only one
   open PR at a time.
3. **Validate locally.** The miner runs `kata submission validate` before opening the PR.
4. **Open PR.** The PR targets the default competition branch and only touches the
   submission bundle. The submission directory/id prefix and `submission.json`
   `author` must match the GitHub account that opens the PR.
5. **Intake.** `kata-bot` screens the PR (shape + cheap static anti-cheat) and labels it
   `kata:pending` — it now waits for the next round. A failing or identity-mismatched
   PR is closed `kata:invalid` before pending. Suspicious but non-conclusive evidence is
   held as `kata:review` and cannot score yet. A clean push can re-enter screening.
   Hard rejects cannot be bypassed.
   Pushing a commit to a benched (`kata:stale`) PR re-enters it as `kata:pending`.

**Round — when a competition round starts:**

6. **Lock pending entrants.** The round snapshots currently-open PRs that carry
   `kata:pending`, keeps one PR per contributor (extras closed `kata:invalid`), and
   applies the re-entry rule — a kept-open PR is re-scored only if its commit or the
   king changed since it last competed. `kata:review` and unlabeled PRs do not enter.
7. **Execution screener & mark.** The round does not re-run full static/LLM screening;
   that already happened at intake or on the latest push/review command. If enabled,
   the one-project execution screener runs before scoring. Candidates that fail it are
   closed `kata:invalid`; candidates that pass are labeled `kata:executing`.
8. **Score.** Kata scores the **cached** king and every candidate on the same
   secretly-sampled problems, then ranks them.
9. **Decide & apply.** The top candidate that strictly beats the king wins. The bot
   applies outcome labels: winner → merge + promote; a runner-up that also beat the king →
   kept open `kata:pending`; a candidate that didn't → closed `kata:losing`.
10. **Promote.** The verified winner is merged and published as the new king under `kings/`.

## Evaluation Stages

The stages below are the contributor-visible flow for the current vulnerability-audit
competition target.

### 1. Validation

Validation checks the candidate bundle before any expensive sandbox work:

- exactly one submission directory
- required files are present
- `agent.py` defines a valid synchronous `agent_main`
- Python sources compile
- the target competition exists and is active
- the bundle uses the supported small bundle layout and stays within size
  limits: max 16 files, max 64 KiB per file, max 128 KiB total
- obvious secret leakage and benchmark-answer leakage are rejected
- model/sampling fields are handled by the relay at runtime, not rejected just
  because they appear in source
- benchmark-specific answer replay is rejected; agents may use general reusable
  analysis heuristics, but must not recognize known benchmark projects and return
  prewritten findings

### 2. Screening

Screening has two parts:

**Static screening — runs during PR intake/update, before pending.** Cheap, source-only
checks (no model calls). If a hard rule fails, the PR is closed immediately with the
reason and never receives `kata:pending`:

- hardcoded provider keys or validator-secret env references
- benchmark-answer leakage indicators
- benchmark-specific answer replay, including exact project fingerprints, known
  finding IDs, or prewritten findings for known benchmark projects
- async or non-callable `agent_main`
- a stub that directly returns `{"vulnerabilities": []}` without doing any analysis

Static screening currently allows:

- Python helper modules under `helpers/`
- normal request fields such as `temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`, and `seed`

Those request fields are still ignored or stripped by the relay during execution, so
they do not create a model-control advantage.

**Round-start smoke test — runs before scoring when enabled.** Kata runs the candidate
once on a real benchmark project before scoring. This gate checks only that the agent executes
successfully and returns valid report JSON with a top-level `vulnerabilities` list. It
does **not** require the agent to find a vulnerability on the screener project, and it
does not contribute to the final score. If it fails because of candidate behavior, the
PR is closed `kata:invalid` as a screening failure, not `kata:losing`.

**Execution note — informational only; never closes a PR.** The candidate already runs
on every sampled project inside main scoring, so Kata reuses those runs to record a
per-problem findings note — e.g. *"produced findings on 2/7 problems"* — for feedback.
A bad, empty, or unparsable result on a scored problem is simply **scored 0 for that
problem**, never a rejection. An agent that finds nothing loses on score; it is not
"screened out". A *non-stub* agent that happens to return no findings is fine.

When the optional screener is disabled, there is no separate screening sandbox run and
no separate screening timeout; each agent runs once per selected project inside the
round, under the normal execution timeout.

### 3. Round scoring

A round scores the king against **all** qualified candidates on the **same** problem set.

- **The king is cached.** Its per-project scores are stored keyed by the king artifact
  and benchmark version, so the king is scored at most once per problem — not re-run for
  every round or every candidate. It is recomputed only when the king or benchmark changes.
- **One sampled problem set per round.** The round samples the round's problems once
  (secret-seeded); every candidate faces that identical set, so results are directly
  comparable. Different rounds sample different problems, which prevents overfitting.
- Each selected project runs 3 times. A project
  passes only if at least 2 of 3 runs return PASS.
- Scoring is **resilient** — every selected project is scored, and a bad or invalid result
  on one project (scored 0 for that project) does not abort the rest.
- The scorer returns metrics for each project: true positives, total expected,
  detection rate, precision, F1, and PASS/FAIL.
- Each candidate's per-project scores are summarized, and candidates are ranked by
  project pass/fail score first. Detection rate remains visible as a diagnostic metric.

The selected project keys are recorded in the round summary after the round, so
contributors can verify that every candidate faced the same set.

### 4. Promotion Gate

A candidate promotes only if all conditions pass:

- screening passed
- candidate strictly beats the king by rank
- the result is fresh against the current king and benchmark state

The rank comparator is:

1. Project pass score: passed projects / selected projects
2. codebase pass count
3. true positives
4. fewer invalid/error evaluations
5. precision
6. F1 score

Same score and same tie-breakers are not enough; the candidate must strictly
beat the current king.

Project pass score follows the benchmark leaderboard style: a project only counts as
passed when all expected high/critical findings are found reliably. With
3 replicas per project, Kata uses the 2-of-3 project pass rule.
Detection score is still recorded as `total_true_positives / total_expected_vulnerabilities`
for diagnostics and public proof.

Metric meanings:

- `true positives`: benchmark vulnerabilities the agent correctly found.
- `precision`: how many reported findings were real matches,
  `true_positives / total_found`.
- `F1 score`: balance between detection score and precision.
- `invalid/error evaluation`: the sandbox or scorer could not produce a valid
  successful evaluation for that project. It contributes zero metrics and hurts
  tie-breaks.

Sandbox `PASS` still means a project run found all expected vulnerabilities.
Passed project count is the primary promotion score.

## Round Outcomes

At the end of a round, each PR resolves to one outcome (and its label):

- **Winner** (`kata:winner:<target>`) — the top candidate that strictly beat the king; it is
  merged and promoted. At most one per round. Winners also receive exactly one
  `kata:reward:*` tier for Gittensor/SN74 reward weighting.
- **Kept pending** (`kata:pending`) — a candidate that beat the king but was not the top
  challenger; it stays open to compete again next round.
- **Losing** (`kata:losing`) — a candidate that entered scoring but did not beat the
  king; closed.
- **Invalid** (`kata:invalid`) — failed intake screening, failed round-start execution
  screener, or an extra open PR beyond the one-per-contributor limit; closed.
- **Review** (`kata:review`) — suspicious but non-conclusive screening evidence; held out
  of rounds until review clears it or the miner pushes a clean update.
- **Stale** (`kata:stale`) — a kept-open PR that was unchanged since it last competed (same
  commit and same king), so it is skipped this round; a push re-enters it as pending.
- **Hold** (`kata:hold`) — a winner whose merge is currently blocked (merge conflict, or a
  pre-merge promotion check that would leave the king un-updated); held for attention rather
  than merged into a broken state.

Internally the engine still reduces a single candidate's result to one of `merge`,
`close-losing`, `close-invalid`, or `rerun-stale`; the round applies these across the batch
and maps them to the labels above.

## Winner Reward Tiers

The reward tier is separate from the promotion decision. A candidate must first win the
round and pass the pre-merge promotion checks. Then Kata reads the verified challenge
summary and applies one tier:

| Label | Condition |
| --- | --- |
| `kata:reward:s` | valid promotion below the higher tier thresholds |
| `kata:reward:m` | candidate true positives >= 3, or candidate beats king by >= 2 true positives, or score delta >= 15% |
| `kata:reward:l` | candidate true positives >= 5, or candidate beats king by >= 4 true positives, or detection score >= 60% |
| `kata:reward:xl` | candidate true positives >= 8, or candidate beats king by >= 6 true positives, or detection score >= 85% |

Gittensor uses the highest matching label multiplier on the merged PR. A base winner label
identifies the competition target (`kata:winner:sn60__bitsec`), while the reward tier determines whether
the promotion is scored as small, medium, large, or extra-large. Gittensor also applies
time decay to merged winners, so a newer king has more reward weight than an older winner
PR inside the lookback window.

## Freshness And Provenance

Every evaluation records enough data to audit the result:

- candidate artifact hash
- king artifact hash
- selected project keys
- benchmark file hash
- sandbox commit
- scorer version
- replica count
- challenge fingerprint

Before merging, Kata verifies that the evaluated candidate still matches the PR,
the king is still current, and the benchmark fingerprint has not changed.

## Promotion

When the final action is `merge`, the production bot:

1. labels the PR with the winning target label
2. labels the PR with the deterministic reward tier
3. merges the PR
4. publishes the candidate bundle under `kings/<target>/<mode>/`
5. updates current king state
6. clears the merged submission directory from `main`

This keeps `submissions/` empty between active PRs while `kings/` remains the
public source of truth for the current best agent.
