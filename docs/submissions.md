# SN60 Miner Submission Checklist

This is the contributor contract for the current Kata competition:

```text
sn60__bitsec / miner
```

Use this checklist before opening a PR. The goal is simple: submit one honest,
general vulnerability-finding agent that can be scored fairly against the current
king. Do not edit engine, benchmark, workflow, or king code in a miner PR.

## Quick Checklist

Your PR is ready when all of these are true:

- The PR touches exactly one directory under
  `submissions/sn60__bitsec/miner/<submission-id>/`.
- The `<submission-id>` is `<github-username>-YYYYMMDD-NN`.
- The `<github-username>` prefix matches the GitHub account that opens the PR.
- `submission.json` `author` also matches the PR author's GitHub username.
- The PR changes at least one agent bundle file, normally `agent.py`.
- The only required files are present: `agent.py`, `agent_manifest.json`, and
  `submission.json`.
- `agent.py` defines a synchronous `agent_main(...)` function.
- `agent_main()` can be called with no arguments.
- `agent_main` returns a dict with top-level `vulnerabilities`.
- The agent does real analysis. It is not an empty stub or canned constant report.
- Optional Python helper files live under `helpers/` only.
- Bundle size stays within the candidate limits: max 16 files, max 128 KiB per
  file, and max 256 KiB total.
- The bundle has no symlinks, hardcoded secrets, provider URLs, or
  benchmark-answer replay logic.
- The bundle passes local validation:

```bash
uv run kata submission validate \
  --path submissions/sn60__bitsec/miner/<submission-id>
```

## Directory Layout

A valid miner PR adds or updates exactly one submission directory:

```text
submissions/
  sn60__bitsec/
    miner/
      <github-username>-YYYYMMDD-NN/
        agent.py
        agent_manifest.json
        submission.json
```

Example:

```text
submissions/sn60__bitsec/miner/alice-20260708-01/
```

If the PR author is `alice`, the submission ID must start with `alice-`. If the
PR author is `jonathanchang31`, then `jonathan-20260708-01` is invalid. Identity
mismatches are closed as `kata:invalid` before the PR can enter a round.

## Required Files

### `agent.py`

`agent.py` is the executable miner code.

It must define:

```python
def agent_main(project_dir: str | None = None, inference_api: str | None = None) -> dict:
    return {
        "vulnerabilities": [
            {
                "title": "Missing access control on privileged update",
                "description": "Explain the bug and impact clearly.",
                "severity": "high",
                "file": "contracts/Example.sol",
            }
        ]
    }
```

Requirements:

- `agent_main` must be synchronous. The SN60 runner calls it directly and does
  not await coroutines.
- `agent_main()` must work with no arguments.
- The return value must be JSON-serializable.
- The top-level result must include `vulnerabilities`.
- Each finding should include a clear title, description, severity, and source
  location when possible.
- A direct empty return such as `{"vulnerabilities": []}` is rejected as a no-op.
- A constant canned report that does not read or analyze the project is rejected
  as a fake agent.
- A real agent that analyzes the project but happens to find nothing during a
  run is not closed; that project simply scores 0.
- If the round-start smoke test is enabled, your agent must
  run successfully and return valid JSON with a top-level `vulnerabilities` list.
  The smoke test does not require a finding and does not count toward your score.

### `agent_manifest.json`

Use exactly this runtime contract:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 1,
  "runtime": "python",
  "entrypoint": "agent.py"
}
```

### `submission.json`

Example:

```json
{
  "schema_version": 2,
  "subnet_pack": "sn60__bitsec",
  "mode": "miner",
  "submission_id": "alice-20260708-01",
  "created_at": "2026-07-08T00:00:00+00:00",
  "author": "alice",
  "title": "short optional title",
  "notes": "short optional notes"
}
```

Requirements:

- `schema_version` must be `2`.
- `subnet_pack` must match the path, normally `sn60__bitsec`.
- `mode` must be `miner`.
- `submission_id` must match the directory name.
- `author` must match the GitHub account that opened the PR.

## Model Access

Miners do not bring API keys. Kata provides a sandbox inference proxy
and pins the model for every agent.

Use this contract:

- Endpoint: `POST <inference_api>/inference`
- `inference_api`: use the `agent_main(..., inference_api=...)` argument, or
  `INFERENCE_API`
- Auth header: `x-inference-api-key`
- API key source: `INFERENCE_API_KEY`
- Request shape: OpenAI-style chat body, for example
  `{"messages": [...], "max_tokens": 4000}`
- Response: read `choices[0].message.content`
- Do not use `Authorization: Bearer`
- You may include normal request fields, but the relay ignores/strips `model`,
  `temperature`, `top_p`, `top_k`, `seed`, and similar sampling knobs.
  Do not rely on them for behavior.

Current validation inference uses the pinned Qwen model:

```text
qwen/qwen3.6-35b-a3b
```

Per problem, the relay enforces:

- up to 3 successful model calls
- up to 150,000 input tokens total
- up to 24,000 output tokens total
- each call is capped at 32,000 output tokens
- further calls return HTTP `429`

Handle failures and `429` by returning the findings you already have. Do not
crash just because one model call failed.

Minimal example:

```python
import json
import os
import urllib.request


def ask_model(inference_api, prompt):
    endpoint = (inference_api or os.environ.get("INFERENCE_API") or "").rstrip("/")
    body = json.dumps(
        {
            "messages": [{"role": "user", "content": prompt}],
            "max_tokens": 4000,
        }
    ).encode()
    request = urllib.request.Request(
        endpoint + "/inference",
        data=body,
        method="POST",
        headers={
            "Content-Type": "application/json",
            "x-inference-api-key": os.environ.get("INFERENCE_API_KEY", ""),
        },
    )
    with urllib.request.urlopen(request, timeout=120) as response:
        data = json.loads(response.read().decode())
    return data["choices"][0]["message"]["content"]
```

## What Gets Closed Before A Round

Kata closes a PR as `kata:invalid` before adding `kata:pending` when there is a
clear hard failure:

- More than one open PR from the same contributor. Keep one active PR and push
  updates to it.
- The PR edits anything outside its single submission directory.
- The PR edits no agent bundle file.
- The submission path, `submission_id`, or `submission.json` metadata does not
  match.
- The GitHub username in the submission ID or metadata does not match the PR
  author.
- Required files are missing or malformed.
- `agent.py` has invalid Python syntax.
- `agent_main` is missing, async, or cannot be called with no arguments.
- The agent is a no-op stub or constant canned report.
- The bundle contains unsupported files, symlinks, too many files, or oversized
  files. Current candidate limits are max 16 files, max 128 KiB per file, and
  max 256 KiB total. Python helpers are allowed only under `helpers/`.
- The bundle contains hardcoded API keys, provider endpoints, or direct
  references to provider/scoring secret env vars such as `OPENAI_API_KEY`,
  `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `CHUTES_API_KEY`, or `KATA_VALIDATOR_API_KEY`.
- The bundle includes benchmark-answer leakage tokens such as
  `expected_findings`, `ground_truth`, `answer_key`, `scabench`, or `hardsteer`.
- The agent hardcodes benchmark project IDs, known finding IDs, known report
  titles, long answer text, or prewritten findings for known benchmark projects.
- The agent is an exact or AST-equivalent copy of the current king.

General reusable analysis logic is allowed. Project-specific answer replay is
not allowed.

## What Gets Held For Review

Suspicious but non-conclusive evidence is labeled `kata:review`, not
`kata:pending`. A PR with `kata:review` cannot enter a round.

Examples:

- Near-copy similarity that is not an exact king copy.
- Ambiguous benchmark-fingerprint logic.
- Suspicious static report banks.
- Optional LLM review evidence that supports manual review.

If your PR is held for review, either wait for project review or push a clean update
that removes the suspicious behavior. Concrete cheating, invalid identity, invalid
PR shape, or benchmark-answer replay cannot enter a round.

## What Happens In A Round

Opening a PR does not score it immediately. After intake, a passing PR waits as
`kata:pending` until the next round starts.

In each round:

- Kata snapshots open candidate PRs at their current commits.
- Only one open PR per contributor is allowed.
- The current commit must match the commit that passed intake screening.
- If enabled, each candidate runs one real executable smoke test before scoring.
  This checks that the agent runs and returns a valid `vulnerabilities` report.
  It does not require a true-positive finding.
- The king and all candidates are scored on the same randomly sampled SN60
  benchmark problems.
- In SN60-compatible production mode, each selected project runs 3 times and a
  project passes only if at least 2 of 3 runs return PASS.
- A bad, empty, slow, or crashed result on one problem scores 0 for that problem.
  It does not close the PR by itself.
- The top candidate that strictly beats the king is merged and promoted.
- A candidate that beats the king but is not the top winner stays open as
  `kata:pending` for the next round.
- A candidate that does not beat the king is closed as `kata:losing`.

Promotion comparison order:

1. Higher SN60 pass score: passed projects / selected projects.
2. More passed projects.
3. More true positives.
4. Fewer invalid/error evaluations.
5. Higher precision.
6. Higher F1 score.

## Labels You May See

- `kata:pending`: screened and waiting for the next round.
- `kata:review`: held for review; cannot enter a round yet.
- `kata:executing`: currently competing in a round.
- `kata:winner:<target>`: merged and promoted to king.
- `kata:reward:*`: Gittensor reward tier for a merged winner.
- `kata:losing`: competed but did not beat the king.
- `kata:invalid`: failed screening or one-open-PR rule.
- `kata:stale`: skipped because the PR commit and king were unchanged since the
  last time it competed.
- `kata:hold`: won, but merge/promotion needs attention.

## Local Commands

Create a submission:

```bash
uv run kata submission init \
  --subnet-pack sn60__bitsec \
  --mode miner \
  --submission-id <github-user>-YYYYMMDD-01 \
  --author <github-user>
```

Validate before opening a PR:

```bash
uv run kata submission validate \
  --path submissions/sn60__bitsec/miner/<github-user>-YYYYMMDD-01
```

Then commit only that submission directory and open one PR.

Run these commands from the top-level Kata repository directory.
